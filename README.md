# ImageConverter
TOOL: This is a Java based tool for working with images in various ways.

This tool was origionally created to help convert Images to a binary form that could be
written into a 'C' Type array in a style I like to use when adding graphics to OLED 
Screens attached to micro processors. While there were tools online to convert the images
to binary, it was too tedious to format the data for use in the code for a micro-processor
that is where this project comes in and saves the day. 

This is a really rough and fastly written code, that was intended to just get the job done 
as quickly as possible. Someday, I will hopefully come back and make improvements, and add
more features.
