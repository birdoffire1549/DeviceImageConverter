# Device Image Converter
TOOL: This is a Java based tool for working with images in various ways.

This tool was originally created to help convert Images to a binary form that could be
written into a 'C' Type array in a style I like to use when adding graphics to OLED 
Screens attached to micro processors. While there were tools online to convert the images to binary, it was too tedious to format the data for use in the code for a micro-processor that is where this project comes in and saves the day. 

I decided to go with a Java Swing Application because I wanted to show the resized images in a Mock Screen so I could see what the size of the image would look like in the bounds of the display. Also I wanted to be able to resize the image repeatedly quickly, and know what the changes would roughly look like.
